    "Let's answer this question by building our own **portfolio and backtest tool** using **Python**. We will start by loading some historical data using the  [Yahoo Finance API](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), explore and prepare a dataset, and then build a backtesting function to assess if investing those $200 every month using **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)** would have been a good idea.\n",

    "The code used in this post is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/batmaxx/portfolio-backtesting-tool), feel free to clone the project to follow along with the notebook. I tried to put everything in clear and concise functions that you can easily reuse in your program.\n",
